                            our customers have come to the site through one of our partner sites so that we can credit them
                            appropriately and where applicable allow our affiliate partners to provide any bonus that they

                            cookies through our site which may be used to enhance your profile on their site or contribute

                        <p>Hopefully that has clarified things for you and as was previously mentioned if there is something
                            that you aren&rsquo;t sure whether you need or not it&rsquo;s usually safer to leave cookies
